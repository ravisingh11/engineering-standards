# Shared Engineering Skills

This directory is the canonical source for reusable agent skills in the
guardrails repository. Skills are small, task-specific operating
guides that tell Codex how to perform repeatable engineering, security,
release, and repository administration work.

## Policy

- Keep canonical skills here.
- Treat `skills/` in this repository as the active source of truth for shared
  agent skills.
- Prefer linking to these skills from repo-local `AGENTS.md`.
- Copy a skill into a product repo only when the repo needs customization.
- Repo-local copies should live under `docs/ai/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- Keep `_shared-project-ops` with the skill set because multiple skills depend on its scripts and reference templates.
- Do not add machine-local skills such as screen-history or personal-memory tooling to this directory.
- Keep `SKILL.md` concise. Put detailed examples, rubrics, and long procedures under `references/`.
- Every canonical skill must have `agents/openai.yaml`.

## Install Locally

From the repository root:

```bash
tooling/install-skills.sh --list
tooling/install-skills.sh --all --dry-run
tooling/install-skills.sh --all --merge-existing
```

Install behavior:

- First-time installs copy the selected skill and `_shared-project-ops`.
- Existing target skills are skipped by default in non-interactive runs.
- Interactive runs prompt to skip, merge missing files only, or replace.
- `--merge-existing` preserves local files and adds missing canonical files.
- `--replace-existing` fully replaces the target skill and should be used deliberately.

## Skill Catalog

The requested starter set is the Phase 2 foundation:

- `dependency-upgrade`
- `generate-unit-tests`
- `fix-ci`
- `fix-security-finding`
- `address-pr-findings`

The additional skills below are optional shared capabilities. They remain in
this repository because they are reusable, but application repositories should
install only the skills they actually need.

### Core Review And Audit

- `bug-hunter`
- `code-review`
- `config-drift-auditor`
- `data-model-migration-review`
- `dependency-risk-review`
- `docs-sync`
- `frontend-regression-review`
- `full-product-review`
- `full-test-suite`
- `observability-gap-review`
- `onboarding-doc-builder`
- `project-health-check`
- `refactor-safety-check`
- `release-readiness`
- `security-audit-lite`
- `spec-driven-development`
- `test-gap-finder`

### Repository Operations

- `change-guardrail-control`
- `commit-message-enforcer`
- `dependency-remediation`
- `github-actions-hardening`
- `ios-release-qa`
- `ios-testflight-release-cycle`
- `issue-operator`
- `license-compliance`
- `multi-tenant-saas-readiness`
- `repo-admin-hygiene`
- `repo-bootstrap`
- `ruleset-governance`
- `skill-installer`

## Which Skill To Use

- Use `repo-bootstrap` for a new or newly adopted repo.
- Use `change-guardrail-control` whenever a capability, provider, producer,
  evidence contract, activation setting, or enforcement mode changes.
- Use `repo-admin-hygiene` for descriptions, homepages, topics, labels, default branches, Wikis, Projects, and GitHub metadata.
- Use `license-compliance` for root `LICENSE` files and first-party package metadata.
- Use `dependency-remediation` for Dependabot, Snyk, npm audit, package drift, and lockfile cleanup.
- Use `github-actions-hardening` for workflow permissions, secrets, OIDC, action pinning, and CI/CD supply-chain posture.
- Use `ruleset-governance` for branch, tag, push, and required-check rulesets.
- Use `commit-message-enforcer` for commit history hygiene and Conventional Commit enforcement.
- Use `spec-driven-development` for substantial feature work that should start
  from Spec Kit specs, plans, tasks, and release evidence.
- Use `multi-tenant-saas-readiness` before launching or hardening tenant-scoped
  SaaS products.
- Use `ios-release-qa` for release-candidate QA around environment locks,
  accessibility, iPad/device flows, and App Store/TestFlight readiness.
- Use `full-test-suite` for a broad scan-fix-verify loop across the project-ops skills.
- Use `skill-installer` to install or refresh canonical skills locally.

## Support Bundle

- `_shared-project-ops/references`: shared finding, issue, severity, dedupe, rerun, and verification templates.
- `_shared-project-ops/scripts`: shared state tooling used by `full-test-suite`, `issue-operator`, and audit skills.

## Maintenance

- Add a new skill only when the workflow is repeated, fragile, or broadly useful enough to justify durable instructions.
- Keep frontmatter to `name` and `description`.
- Make the description explicit about when the skill should trigger.
- Add `agents/openai.yaml` with a human-readable display name, short description, and default prompt.
- Put deterministic logic in `scripts/` and long guidance in `references/`.
- Avoid storing secrets, local paths, screenshots, machine-specific history, or personal memory details in skills.
- Run validation before committing.

```bash
python3 tooling/validate-skills.py
```

## Drift Control

When a repo has copied skills, compare its local copy against this directory
before editing. Update copied skills with a scoped commit, issue note, or pull
request when that repository chooses to use PRs, so changes remain visible and
reviewable.

If a product repo diverges from the canonical skill, document why in the repo-local copy. Otherwise, refresh it from this directory.
