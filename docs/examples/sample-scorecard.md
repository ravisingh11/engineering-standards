# Sample Guardrails v2 scorecard

This representative output shows all four readiness colors. The build
capability is enforced and has no authoritative result, so the overall decision
is `BLOCK`. Advisory gaps remain `ORANGE`; inactive capabilities remain `GRAY`.

# Guardrail Scan Report

- Status: **RED**
- Decision: **BLOCK**
- Evidence: `.artifacts/guardrails/evidence-20260828-120000Z.json`

| Readiness | Mode | Capability — Provider | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GREEN | advisory | Repository Validation — Repository Validators | passed |
| ORANGE | advisory | PR Change Scope — PR Change Scope | failed |
| ORANGE | advisory | Documentation Validation — Repository Validators | no_result |
| RED | enforced | Build — Repository Build Command | no_result |
| GREEN | advisory | Unit Tests — Repository Unit Test Command | passed |
| ORANGE | advisory | Custom Static Analysis — Semgrep Community Edition | no_result |
| ORANGE | advisory | Secret Detection — Gitleaks CLI | no_result |
| ORANGE | advisory | Deep SAST — GitHub CodeQL | no_result |
| GRAY | not_activated | Artifact Provenance — Not activated | not_activated |
| GRAY | not_activated | Container Vulnerability — Not activated | not_activated |
```

For example, a scope check can explain the orange row directly:

```text
Meaningful: 17 files, 1,284 changed lines (916 added). Total: 19 files,
1,472 changed lines. Excluded: 2 files, 188 changed lines.
```

The mechanical provider owns those counts. AI review may identify three
concern clusters and recommend independent PR boundaries, but it does not
recalculate the metrics or change the policy decision.

The real `--all-catalog-controls` report includes every catalog capability. The
abbreviated table preserves the exact renderer vocabulary and row format. Its
`Artifact Provenance` row is catalog visibility only; the current release
attestation workflow does not produce nested artifact evidence for a release
scorecard.

Generate a current report with:

```sh
python3 .guardrails/scan.py --all-catalog-controls
```

See the runnable [Python demo](../../examples/python-demo/) and the
[status guide](../control-status.md).
